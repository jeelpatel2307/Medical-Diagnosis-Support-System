### Medical Diagnosis Support System

This Java application provides a basic framework for a Medical Diagnosis Support System. It prompts the user to enter their symptoms, performs a diagnosis based on the symptoms (using a dummy implementation), and then displays the diagnosis result.

### How to Use:

1. Clone the repository or copy the Java code into a file.
2. Compile the Java file using any Java compiler (e.g., `javac MedicalDiagnosisSystem.java`).
3. Run the compiled class file (e.g., `java MedicalDiagnosisSystem`).
4. Follow the prompts to enter the symptoms.
5. The application will provide a diagnosis based on the symptoms entered.

### Features:

- **User Input**: Allows users to input their symptoms.
- **Diagnosis**: Performs a diagnosis based on the symptoms provided.
- **Dummy Implementation**: Uses a dummy implementation for diagnosis (can be replaced with more sophisticated algorithms).
- **Console Interface**: Utilizes a simple console interface for user interaction.

### Further Enhancements:

- **Sophisticated Diagnosis Algorithms**: Implement more advanced algorithms for diagnosis.
- **Integration with Medical Databases/APIs**: Integrate with medical databases or APIs to improve accuracy.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Implement a GUI for better user interaction and visualization of results.

### Note:

This is a basic implementation for demonstration purposes. In a real-world scenario, a Medical Diagnosis Support System would require more extensive development and testing to ensure accuracy and reliability.
